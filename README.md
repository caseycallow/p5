Many songs can be found in publicly available datasets in JSON format. This project takes in a song's JSON file and transforms it using P5.js into a radial image based on note velocity and pitch. Color is determined based on the velocity/volume of each note. Line length is determined by the note pitch (higher notes = longer lines).
